S086,Aix Marseille Université,The French public's attitudes to a future COVID-19 vaccine: The politicization of a public health issue,"As COVID-19 spreads across the world, governments turn a hopeful eye towards research and development of a vaccine against this new disease. But it is one thing to make a vaccine available, and it is quite another to convince the public to take the shot, as the precedent of the 2009 H1N1 influenza illustrated. In this paper, we present the results of four online surveys conducted in April 2020 in representative samples of the French population 18 years of age and over (N?=?5018). These surveys were conducted during a period when the French population was on lockdown and the daily number of deaths attributed to the virus reached its peak. We found that if a vaccine against the new coronavirus became available, almost a quarter of respondents would not use it. We also found that attitudes to this vaccine were correlated significantly with political partisanship and engagement with the political system. Attitudes towards this future vaccine did not follow the traditional mapping of political attitudes along a Left-Right axis. The rift seems to be between people who feel close to governing parties (Centre, Left and Right) on the one hand, and, on the other, people who feel close to Far-Left and Far-Right parties as well as people who do not feel close to any party. We draw on the French sociological literature on ordinary attitudes to politics to discuss our results as well as the cultural pathways via which political beliefs can affect perceptions of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jeremy K.

Our analysis shows a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabs in and outside the Arab region (83% and 81%, respectively). The most cited reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and distrust in healthcare policies, vaccine expedited production, published studies and vaccine producing companies. We also found that female participants, participants 30-59 year-old, those with no chronic diseases, those with lower-level of academic education, and those who do not know the type of vaccine authorized in their countries are more hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination. On the other hand, participants who regularly receive the influenza vaccine, health care workers, and those from countries with higher rates of COVID-19 infections showed more vaccination willingness.

Restrictions on movement imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 preclude the preferred methodology of area based sampling. Random digit dialling (RDD) is also unfeasible. Therefore, respondents for the survey will have to be selected through a purposive, non-probability sampling approach.  To ensure that this approach will still yield the best possible information, three design elements have been included. First, the survey was conducted as a panel so that results can be compared across cycles. Second, efforts were made to include a diverse group of respondents, and responses will be calibrated. Third, a randomized vignette experiment provides key information on the interaction of age, gender, health, and confirmed COVID-19 cases on social distancing. Respondents for the survey were recruited through a nonprobability sample and soft quotas for geographical areas and different gender groups were used. The survey was then calibrated using a generalized regression estimator. Calibration increases the weight of some respondents and decreases the weight of other respondents so that the survey more accurately represents the population of interest.  The survey was calibrated on four variables: gender, age, governorate, and community size. Several other variables, namely shelter status and number of household members working, were considered but the survey proportions for these variables were judged acceptable. Three categories for age were utilized: 18 – 34, 35 – 59, and 60 and older. Communities were categorized as large (> 20,000 inhabitants), medium (20,000 – 2,000 inhabitants), and small (<2,000 inhabitants). Estimates for gender and age were taken from a representative survey for NES. Population estimates were taken from HNAP’s February Mobility and Needs Monitoring.  After calibration, the survey proportions for the calibration variables (gender, age, governorate, and community size) exactly matched the estimated population proportions. Proportions were also compared to several benchmark variables. Proportions for marital status and displacement status (IDP v. host community) were within one percentage point of population estimates and proportions for chronic illness were within approximately 3 percentage points.

The survey also shows that a large proportion of respondents are concerned about the consequences of the epidemic on the deepening of inequalities and the increase in violence and insecurity. The results highlight both common features and great heterogeneity in perception and behavioral response at the individual and regional levels, thus providing useful information for Burkina Faso's decision-makers to better calibrate the prevention strategies to be implemented as the pandemic accelerates in Burkina as in other African countries and the prospect of broad immunization coverage remains both distant and highly uncertain.","Jacky Mathonnat, Martine Audibert, Vincent Nossek",WCAR,Burkina Faso,BFA,1,"Practice, Social environment","Community engagement - satisfaction, Community engagement - trust, COVID-19 economic impact, Protective measures - Individual",MISC,1000,All,National,Internal review,,Report,,Ferdi,https://ferdi.fr/dl/df-UBHHnPLN1Ccpmfh4LJxppBHM/wp286-ferdi-perception-de-la-covid-et-comportement-des-menages-au-burkina-faso.pdf,2021-03-01,"public awareness, public practice, protective measures (KAP), risk perception, trust",Processed,,Stratified sample,Y,2021-10-21 09:39:21
